Your aim is to earn as many points as you can.

You can earn point by:
    1. Building paths.
Every path has a color, so to build path you must have enough wagon cards with suitable color.

    2. Finish routes
Route is considered to be built if you have continuous path between two cities.

Start game.
    1. You are getting 3 short and 1 long routes, but you still can take more.
Be aware of taking too many routes, because for every unfinished route you lose points.

    2. You are getting 4 random wagon cards.
    3. Youngest player moves first.

Game logic.
You can make one of the following turns:
    1. Take 2 cards from table or from deck. But, if you want to take locomotive card from table, that requires full turn.
    2. Build path. (Pay attention that some path are tunnels, so 3 more cards will be drawn from the deck and for every card with the
    same color as your path's color you will have to give away one move wagon card with the same color).
